    If you do not know how basic right triangles work, read this article on wikipedia[1] .: A Pythagorean tripple is a right triangle that has three sides that are all whole positive integers 
    Allows the user to input the sides of any triangle in any order.(will take in 3 arguments x y and z, then the program will sort them from smallest to largest and sort them from a to c)
    Return whether the triangle is a Pythagorean Triple or not. (All i need to check is if the two smaller sides work out correctly to the c value)
    Loop the program so the user can use it more than once without having to restart the program. Capture everything inside of a while loop
